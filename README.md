# Restaurant Page JavaScript

> In this project I built a restaurant page with javascript. It has three tabs- Home, Menu and Contact. When user clicks on any tab, application dynamically updates the UI.
> App uses JavaScript modules to seprate the logic of each component, and webpack to manage module files and to build bundle file.
